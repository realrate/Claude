## Logo fixes

**Manual override** — drop a PNG at `assets/logos/<company_name_lowercase_underscores>.png`
Example: `Visteon CORP` → `assets/logos/visteon_corp.png`

**Domain hint** — add to `_DOMAIN_HINTS` in `generate_infographic.py`, then delete the bad cached file in `assets/logos/`. Use this whenever a logo is wrong or missing.

**White/light logo detection** — `_logo_is_light()` automatically detects logos where ≥60% of visible pixels have brightness >200 (white-on-transparent). These are rendered on a near-black `(18, 18, 18)` background instead of the default white box, so the logo stays visible. No manual action needed — applies to any industry automatically.

Current domain overrides:

| Company | Domain |
|---------|--------|
| Bristow Group Inc | `bristowgroup.com` |
| Allegiant Travel CO | `allegiantair.com` |
| Strata Critical Medical Inc | `stratacritical.com` |
| Abrdn (all ETF trusts) | `abrdn.com` |

## LinkedIn post generation

**Always generate both** — whenever you write a LinkedIn post, also run `generate_infographic.py` to produce the matching PNG.

### Rules

- **Title:** `🏆 TOP 10 US [INDUSTRY] COMPANIES RANKING [CURRENT YEAR]`
- **Subtitle:** `RealRate Financial Strength Rankings using Artificial Intelligence`
- **Data:** Fetch `https://realrate-archive.com/us_{slug}/{latest_year}/website-ranking.json` (use `curl -sk`). ECR = `value` × 100, rounded. Latest year = highest number in the directory listing.
- **Company scope:** Never say "US-listed". Use "US Motor companies", "US Software companies", etc.
- **Hook:** Two sharp, industry-specific sentences ending with *"Here is who is built to last."* Fresh every post — never reuse or echo a previous hook. First sentence must be a specific, surprising insight, not a generic opener.
- **Methodology block** (fixed, verbatim every time):
  > At RealRate, we go beyond correlation.
  > Our explainable AI framework reveals not just where each company stands, but why. Giving you a clear view of the underlying drivers of financial resilience, risk exposure, and long-term stability. At the core is Economic Capital Ratio (ECR) — a forward-looking metric that measures how efficiently a company converts its economic value into balance sheet strength, enabling true comparability across size and business models.
- **Market average:** One line after methodology block: `Market average ECR: X%`
- **Top 3:** Medal emoji + rank + name + ECR% + 2–3 tight sentences (strength driver, pp above market, rank trend, punchy "so what").
- **Ranks 4–10:** `#4 Name (X%) | #5 Name (X%) | … | #10 Name (X%)`
- **CTA:** One punchy, industry-specific question. Never reuse. No generic filler.
- **Link:** `🔗 https://realrate.ai/rankings/[industry]/[current year]`
- **Hashtags:** Exactly 8. Always: `#Finance #AI #Investing #RealRate #FinancialHealth #FinancialAnalysis` + 1 industry tag + 1 company name from top 3. Never use: `#Technology #Innovation #StockMarket #USStocks #TopRated #CloudComputing #Cybersecurity`
